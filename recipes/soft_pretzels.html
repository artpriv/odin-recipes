<p>Basic Soft Pretzels! Necessary dippers for your beer cheese soup ♡</p>
<p>Total time: <em>1 hour 15 minutes</em></p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup warm <strong>milk</strong></li>
    <li>1 package <strong> instant yeast</strong></li>
    <li>3 tablespoons <strong>brown sugar</strong></li>
    <li>2 tablespoons <strong>melted butter</strong></li>
    <li>1 teaspoon <strong>salt</strong></li>
    <li>2 1/4 cups <strong>all-purpose flour</strong></li>
    <li>more <strong>flour</strong> for dusting</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Make the Dough: In a mixing bowl, gently whisk the warm milk, yeast, brown sugar, butter, and salt. Stir in the flour until a dough forms. Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead 10-15 times.</li>
    <li>Let the Dough Hang Out: Return to the bowl and drizzle with a little oil to prevent sticking. Cover with a cloth or plastic wrap and set aside for an hour to rise.</li>
    <li>Pretzel-ify: When the dough has risen, punch it back down and divide it into 6-8 sections. Roll each section into a loooong skinny rope. Fold it into a pretzel. Dip into the baking soda solution and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Bake: Brush with the beaten egg and sprinkle with salt. Bake at 450 degrees for 10-12 minutes, until golden brown. YUUUUUM! Dip in cheese sauce, mustard, or my personal favorite – beer cheese soup.</li>
